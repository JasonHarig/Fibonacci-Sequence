# Fibonacci-Sequence
JavaScript Fibonacci Sequence

In mathematics the Fibonacci numbers form a sequence known as the Fibonacci sequence. In this sequence each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
Fibonacci numbers are strongly related to the Golden ratio. This has all been paraphrased from Wikipedia. Read more here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number .

This script will generate only Fibonacci numbers. The sequnce adds the previous number to the next to create the prov proceeding number. For example, four  iterations of the sequence would be as follows 0, 1, 1, 2. Starting with 0, 0 is then added to 1, giving us 1, then 1 is added to 1 giving us 2. 
The sequence below is set to 20. Note that it always starts at 0.

0,	1,	1,	2,	3,	5,	8,	13,	21,	34,	55,	89,	144,	233,	377,	610,	987,	1597,	2584,	4181,	6765,

This script uses if else and arrays to assure that 0,1 and 0,1,1 are given for iterations of both 2 and 3.
